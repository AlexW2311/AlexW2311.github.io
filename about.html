    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p id="aboutMe">I’m a software engineer focused on game development, with most of my work centered around C# and C++ in Unity. I enjoy building game systems and underlying architecture—things like state management, gameplay frameworks, and tools that make development cleaner, more scalable, and easier to iterate on.

I’m comfortable working independently or as part of a team, and I tend to take ownership of systems from design through implementation. My background working with complex systems has given me a strong attention to detail and an appreciation for maintainable, well-structured code.

Alongside Unity, I’ve worked with a range of technologies including graphics libraries, Swift, and JavaScript, and I’m always interested in learning new approaches to improve both performance and developer workflow. I’m particularly motivated by solving architectural problems in games and turning messy prototypes into solid, production-ready systems.</p>
